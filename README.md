# blockchain-DHT-optimization-Implementation

1. **`blockchain_core_block_and_tansaction.py`** 
   - Complete blockchain implementation with blocks, transactions, Merkle trees
   - B-A tree optimization for storage as described in the paper
   - Zone Block Content Identifiers (ZB-CID) for DHT integration

2. **`DHT(Chord)_implementation_with_routing_and_storage.py`** 
   - Full Chord DHT protocol implementation with 160-bit identifier space
   - Finger table routing and successor list fault tolerance
   - Load balancing with Y1-Y4 state management from the paper
   - Zone block storage and retrieval mechanisms

3. **`Consensus_Mechanism_and_Transaction_verification.py`** 
   - Tendermint consensus optimized with contribution mechanism
   - Four contribution factors: currency age, data collection, state allocation, consensus behavior
   - Complete security mechanisms including protection against eclipse, double-spend, selfish mining, DDoS, and replay attacks
   - Zero-knowledge proof implementation for transaction verification

4. **`network_layer_and p2p_communication.py`** 
   - Full P2P networking layer with message protocol
   - Heartbeat and peer discovery mechanisms
   - Blockchain synchronization manager
   - Asynchronous message processing

5. **`main_integration&complete_system_runner.py`** 
   - Complete system integration bringing all components together
   - BlockchainNode class managing all subsystems
   - BlockchainSimulator for testing with configurable node counts
   - Performance testing suite measuring all metrics from the paper
   - Interactive mode for manual testing

### **Key Features Implemented:**

- **DHT Structure Design** with Chord protocol and ZB-CID mapping
- **Transaction Verification Model** with zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts
- **Contribution-Based Consensus** with the exact formulas from the paper
- **Node Load Balancing** with four states (Y1-Y4) as specified
- **Complete Security Suite** implementing all formulas (5-8) from the paper
- **Performance Metrics** matching the paper's evaluation criteria

### **How to Run:**

1. Save all five Python files in the same directory
2. Install requirements: `pip install cryptography numpy`
3. Run with: `python main_integration.py --nodes 100 --test`

The implementation is fully functional and includes:
- Cryptographic signatures and verification
- Distributed storage and retrieval
- Consensus mechanism with Byzantine fault tolerance
- Load balancing and fault recovery
- Complete networking stack
- Performance measurement tools
